 * Producing a Throwable is the fastest way to retrieve current thread stack.

 * http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6375302
 *
 * We use a name which does not refer to Exception as this is NOT an exception. it should be used to produce logs
 * referring to current thread stack.
 *
 * We extends {@link Throwable} as we do no expect to use this for rethrowing
