 * This class enables 'internalization' of objects referenced by given roots. Typically, given a List of 2 equals but
 * not same Strings, this class enables replacing of the 2 references by the other. It then enables a lower heap (as the
 * 'other' String may have become GC-collectable) and possibly better performances (as some .equals operation may
 * shortcut by first checking reference comparison (i.e. '=='))
